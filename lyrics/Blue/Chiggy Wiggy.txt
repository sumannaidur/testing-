Every man who ever sees me wants to hold my hand
And be the one who gets me to say "Oh, I do"
They swear eternal undying devotion
Yes, they swear that they will love me forever love me true
But I don't need a shining star
And I don't want to be rescued
No neither front nor charming prince
Nor my summers barbecued

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, boy
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, boy
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, fella
Just chiggy-wiggy with you, baby
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, boy
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, boy
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, fella
Just chiggy-wiggy with you, baby

[Verse 2: Kylie Minogue]
Free your mind
Free is the way to live it up
Free to go
Free, if I don't want to give it up
Free to groove
The dance floors where I want to be
Free to move
White picket fences frighten me


[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, boy
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, boy
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, fella
Just chiggy-wiggy with you, baby

[Verse 3: Kylie Minogue]
Ah, ah, don't want a talker
Ah, ah, don't need repartee
Ah, ah, don't need a future
I just like to party
Ah, ah, forget tomarow
Ah, my feeet are tapping
Ah, ah, why dont you get it?
Why won't you let it happen?
Say you'll never go never ever go
Down upon on your knees
Say you'll never say, never ever say
Baby, marry me, please

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, boy
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, boy
I want to chiggy-wiggy with you, feilla
Just chiggy-wiggy with you, baby
