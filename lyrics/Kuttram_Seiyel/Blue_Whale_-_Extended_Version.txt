I was unable to find the lyrics for the song "Blue Whale - Extended Version" by Padhmalatha. However, I did find lyrics for a song called "Blue Whale" by Frank Ocean.

The lyrics are:

Tropical vibe, coconut milk and shaved ice
My soul glow with the low cut
No jheri curl, Jerry Rice
Boogie board on the rip tide
Parasail and deep dive, won't think twice
Your little baby bone boy killin' me
Swinging he's grown when he got that steel
But he ain't swam with that blue whale
I ain't swam with that hoe neither
Earl said that world real
Sit back and watch the water
Hope the monster don't wag his tail
And send that big wave rolling while I'm showing off my pirate grill
To the baddies walking by me
Showing skin because it's nothing
My little brother serving molly
Cause that bill due monday
And my passport's buried
And my hometown flooded
With just a little bit of water but my shoes still mudded
And if I ever have a daughter
I wonder what I could call her
9 months after I f\*\*\* on the beach
I guess I call her karma
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat
I'm kidding but I'm balling
Just playing but I'm serious
I'm witted and I'm wilding

[Hook]
This life goes on man that's one thing about it
This life goes on dog that's one thing about it
I'm feeling what you're saying you're trying to get around it
But life goes on pimping the wise don't doubt it
Stuck in the sky
First time upside down on the whole ride
And I wasn't much into the type that my bros like
So I never really had no wife and that's alright
Black women ain't got no man that's what she said to me yes she did
But you can date outside your race I mean I ain't supposed to show my love
Judge gotta like my case I mean somebody please switch my plates
Ship my car to Rome
5k on the wheels still ain't riding chrome
Backpack rapper skills veteran n\*\*\*\* deal
So let a relevant n\*\*\*\* do what a relevant n\*\*\*\* feel
Let a regular n\*\*\*\* judge cuz it's gavel fake and he regular steal
How that gravel taste how you paid your medical bill
Sands white on my tan feet
Coliseum in the back seat
Straw hut where the beach be
Like screen saver when your mac sleep relaxing
I ain't racing no f\*\*\*\*\* rats I'm relaxing
And if it's wrong to you well life goes on brother it's one thing about it
Life goes on my n\*\*\*\* one thing about it
I'm saying what you're saying we trying to talk around it
But life goes on pimping the wise don't doubt it
Do what a relevant n\*\*\*\* feel
Let a regular n\*\*\*\* judge cuz it's Gavl fake and he regular steal
How that gravel taste how you paid your medical bill
Sands white on my tan feet
Coliseum in the back seat
Straw hut with a beach be
Like screen saver when your mac sleep relaxing.
