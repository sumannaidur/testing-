I was unable to find the full lyrics to the song 'Highland Cathedral' by 'The Band of the Brigade of Gurkhas the Pipes & Drums of the 3rd' in the search results. However, here are some lyrics from different versions of the song:

*   Faithful and loyal to our own country. In times of danger, we will set you free. Lead you to glory and to victory. Hail, Caledonia, to our ancient prayer. In this Highland Cathedral, let our standards, bear. Joining, together, with one dream to share of this land so fair.
*   Gone is the past, let us start anew. Let this hope of peace, always remain. Spirit of Scotia, be strong and true. Then your children will smile again of our God and King.
*   Whom, joy and liberty, to all, will bring. Come; let your heart, with love and courage, sing. Whom, joy and liberty, to all, will bring.
