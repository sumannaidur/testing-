The song 'The Rose of Kelvinside' is actually the song 'Kelvin Grove'. Here are the lyrics:

Will you go to Kelvin Grove
Bonnie lassie, O
Through its mazes let us rove
Bonnie lassie, O
Where the rose in all her pride
Paints the hollow dingle side
Where the midnight fairies glide
Bonnie lassie, O

Let us wander by the mill
Bonnie lassie, O
To the cove beside the rill
Bonnie lassie, O
Where the glens rebound the call
Of the roaring waterfall
Through the mountains' rocky hall
Bonnie lassie, O

Though I dare not call thee mine
Bonnie lassie, O
As the smile of fortune's thine
Bonnie lassie, O
Yet with fortune on my side
I could stay thy father's pride
And win thee for my bride
Bonnie lassie, O

Then farewell to Kelvin Grove
Bonnie lassie, O
And adieu to all I love
Bonnie lassie, O
To the river winding clear
And the fragrant scented brier
Even to thee of all most dear
Bonnie lassie, O
