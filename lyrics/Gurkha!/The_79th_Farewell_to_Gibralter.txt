I was unable to find the full lyrics for the song 'The 79th Farewell to Gibralter' by 'The Band of the Brigade of Gurkhas the Pipes & Drums of the 3rd'. However, I did find some information about the song:

*   It was composed by Pipe Major John Macdonald of the 79th Cameron Highlanders in June 1848, when his regiment left Gibraltar for Canada.
*   The 79th was stationed on the strategic Rock of Gibraltar for three years. They were delighted to leave.
*   The song is considered among the finest marches ever written for pipes and was one of the early quicksteps written for troops on the march.
*   The song had its first public airing when the captain of the ship asked the Pipe Major to have the band play on deck to warn other ships of their presence in a foggy St. Lawrence seaway. The ship avoided collision because the bass drone pipes were in tune with the maritime foghorn.
