Okay, here are the lyrics to "Edharkadi" by Dhruv Vikram, compiled from the search results:

(Music)
Edharkadi vali thandhaai, uyirin thollaiyae
Idharkku mel vali ondrum, ulagil illaiyae
Nee thaanadi, ninaivin thaeniye
En vaazhkaiyae, vizhi neerin theeniye
Ennai kondru saikave, konjam vandhu poi vidu
Unnayi paarkanum…
En swaasam neeye, en artham neeye
En thunbam neeye, ennathin theeye

(Instrumental Break!)

Oru nodi nee, kann marainthayi
Konjal endru naan nadakkurein
Maru nodi kann thiranthu paarkkaiyil
Thanimaiyile kidakkirein
Unnayi thavira edhuvume ishtamillaiye
Vittu pona vedhanaiyae
Vattam pottu ennai nerukkum, kaadhal theeyile
Undhan kangal thedinen, unnai paarkanum…

En swaasam neeye, en artham neeye
En thunbam neeye, ennathin theeye
En swaasam neeye, en artham neeye
En thunbam neeye, ennathin theeye

(Rap lyrics)
Did distance make us distant?
Because existence has got me thinking
Now for instance, if i insisted
What were you on a leash?
Which made me a stray from the street?
Is this what they call defeat?
Coz, baby then this time, I'll bring a fuc__ng fleet

Edharkadi vali thandhai, uyirin thollaiyae
Idharkku mel vali ondrum, ulagil illaiyae
Edharkadi vali thandhai, uyirin thollaiyae
Idharkku mel vali ondrum, ulagil illaiyae
Nee thaanadi, ninaivin theeniye
