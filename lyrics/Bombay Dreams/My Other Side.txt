I live with these walls alone
Looking at mirror, talking to self

Hiding all pain behind
People have seen me sing in halo lights
They Imagine me class so high-fi
But they don't know the other side
You don't know my other side

Happiness I'm looking for
In this lonely searching soul
With only music which doesn't talk to me ever
But tells me what I want to hear
Like an empty glass my life is
Like an empty glass
Like an empty glass

I'm lost alone, all alone
In this tiny room surround

In tiny room surround
I live with these walls alone
Looking at mirror, talking to self
Hiding all pain behind
People have seen me sing in halo lights
They Imagine me class so high-fi
But they don't know the other side
You don't know my other side
