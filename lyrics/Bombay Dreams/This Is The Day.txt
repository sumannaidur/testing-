1 ContributorThis Is The Day LyricsThis is the day we celebrate
Now is the time you listen to me
Now we got each other

We are from different places
And here we're all one
Come let's sing together all
Let's make proud of ourselves

This is the day we celebrate
Now is the time we listen to each other
Let's know each other better
This is the day, we come and learn
We share the best part
Let's make it better together for us

We'll sing songs
And make a melody
Sharing stories, good days and bad days
Everything we need

We are one, never fight each other
It is time, let's sing together

Make it loud, be proud of ourselves
Sing it loud, and be proud of ourselves
Make it loud, make it loud
