6 ContributorsWalk With Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hello dear
You’ve been pulling me closer
Let’s write about you and me
I’ll sing to you a lullaby
Let’s make a story of our own
We walk
Everywhere hand in hand
Walking this path of life
Like life’s been leading us
Together we walk this road

[Verse 2]
You have
Beautiful eyes and smile
It’s melting my heart so fast
Making me love you more
Wanna love you 'til the very end
Darling
Promise me you will stay
Until the very end
No matter what comes in
Together we’ll stay strong
