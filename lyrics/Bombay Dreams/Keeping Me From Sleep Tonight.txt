1 ContributorKeeping Me From Sleep Tonight LyricsLying on my bed with too many illusions
Lights are off and dreaming eyes
Like mingling pictures in my pleading heart

Loud and clear my inner voice
Keeping me from sleep tonight
Keeping me from sleep tonight
Keeping me from sleep tonight

I'm listening to the mysterious ticking noise
Like the world in a giant clock
Leading towards the road downwards
Loan peace to my earthly life
Let me have some sleep tonight

I'm listening to the mysterious ticking noise
Like the world in a giant clock
Leading towards the road downwards
Loan peace to my earthly life
Let me have some sleep tonight

Keeping me from sleep tonight
Keeping me from sleep tonight
Keeping me from sleep tonight
Keeping me from sleep tonight


Keeping me from sleep tonight
Keeping me from sleep tonight
Keeping me from sleep tonight
Keeping me from sleep tonight

Keeping me from sleep tonight
Keeping me from sleep tonight
Keeping me from sleep tonight
Keeping me from sleep tonight
