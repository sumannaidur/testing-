Unfortunately, I donâ€™t have the full lyrics for the song "Daughter Feels - Background Score" by Anirudh Ravichander. While I can confirm the song exists and is part of the "Doctor (Original Background Score)" album, my search did not turn up the actual lyrics.

The song is known to represent the unconditional love and support a father provides to his daughter, highlighting the protective nature of a father.
