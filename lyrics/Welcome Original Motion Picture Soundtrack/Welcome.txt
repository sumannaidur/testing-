6 ContributorsYouâ€™re Welcome Lyrics[Intro: Mary J. Blige]
Turn, turn me up a little bit, when that music comes in it gets loud

[Jay-Z]: Swizzy!!!!!!

[Swizz Beatz] (Jay-Z) (*Mary J. Blige):
YES!!!!!!!! Hands up! Hands up! Hands up high!
Hands up! Hands up! Hands up high! (*La dee da da da!!!)
(It be very different now, Swizzy)
Hands up! Hands up! Hands up high! Hands up! Hands up! Hands up high!
(*Oh oh oh!)
(I need everybody put your hands up, wave from side to side right quick for me)
Slow down Hov, you're killing 'em

[Verse 1: Jay-Z (Swizz Beatz)]
Yeah, you would think I was on 'roids
I been hitting so long and I'm a big headed boy
Nah we ain't on HGH
Though I might pick up some weight when I'm running through your state
(Running through your state) Nah, nah, nah, we ain't on the clear
We on the runway in back to back Lairs (in the air)
Yeah Yeah, it's Ms. No More Drama
And Barack Obama rhymers, feel honored (talk to 'em Hov)
I put my life on these tracks
You act like y'all don't wanna pay me for the facts
Luckily my therapy is to rap
I just bare my soul I don't expect nothing back (get it up)
You're all welcome, long as you felt them
I was gon' get mine, you know where the hell I'm from
I'm from the bottom, so I do this from the diapers
Quick fast, turn the Big Apple into cider
I do this, I'm a writer and a rider
Spew it 'cause I'm nicer, but I do this for the lifers (tell 'em again Hov)
I'm a writer and a rider
Spew it 'cause I'm nicer, but I do this for the lifers, you're welcome


[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
To all of y'all keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
You're all, you're all
You all are welcome
Yeah, now everybody get yo' hands up

[Swizz Beatz]
Hands up, hands up, hands up, high!
Hands up, hands up, hands up, high!

[Mary J. Blige] (Swizz Beatz)
You're all, you're all
You all are welcome
Slow down Hov, you're killing 'em

[Verse 2: Jay-Z (Mary J. Blige) (*Swizz Beatz)]
Yeah yeah, you probably never see again
Somebody so deadly via the pen (no, never, no)
Viva Hovito, my nino, muy bien
Big up to Biggie and Pac, I do it for them
Until I reach Colleek, I do it for him
Do it for those who can't do for self due to the pen
May these bars reach through your bar
And Ma, when Mary sing it heals your heart (*hands up!)
God so Lisa Stansfield you are
Love Is A Battlefield, we all get scarred
I put my heart into this
This is much more than marketed music
The reason I got a market to do this
As there's people going through pain, I'm just walking 'em through this
(I'm here for you) This ain't no marketed music
People going through pain, I'm just talking 'em through it, you're welcome


[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
To all of y'all keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
You're all, you're all
You all are welcome
Yeah, now everybody get yo' hands up

[Swizz Beatz]
Hands up, hands up, hands up, high!
Hands up, hands up, hands up, high!

[Mary J. Blige] (Swizz Beatz)
You're all, you're all
You all are welcome
Slow down Hov, you're killing 'em

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige (Swizz Beatz)]
If it wasn't for your love it would all be a dream
And you made our dreams come true
That's why y'all don't need to thank us
'Cause we do this all for you (talk to 'em Mary!)
We know what you were going through
Because we were going through it too
When no one seems to understand
We were always there to hold your hand


[Verse 4: Jay-Z] (Swizz Beatz)
Sure I taught you 'bout watch brands and watch bands
I also said, "Watch the man hopping out of vans"
I ain't only teach you about Evisu
I told you how to fish and not let other niggas feed you, you're welcome

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
To all of y'all keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
You're all, you're all
You all are welcome
Yeah, now everybody get yo' hands up
