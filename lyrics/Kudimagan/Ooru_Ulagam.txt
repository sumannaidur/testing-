I am unable to find the exact lyrics for a song titled "Ooru Ulagam" performed solely by Velmurugan. However, "Ooru Ulagam" is a phrase that appears in the song "Maari Thara Local" from the movie *Maari*. Velmurugan has also performed in a song titled "Local boys" from the movie *Ethir Neechal*.

The lyrics containing the phrase "Ooru Ulagam" are as follows:

**Maari Thara Local**

Ooru ulagam theriyaadhu
Nyaayam dharmam kedayaadhu
Paadha maara pudikaadhu
Paasam naesam puriyaadhu
Venaam paa hey poochaandi
Namaalu inga thani party
Paakadha vilayaadi
Kedikellaam ivan kedi
Maari konjam nalla maari romba vaera maari
Maari thacha thanga maari moracha singam maari
Paer perusu ivan aal pudhusu
Vazhiyo dhinisu irumbu manasu
Ullara kuthtamila suthamila bathamila
Kuthtamila suthamila kuthtamila suthamila
Paakadha dhooramilla sogamilla baaramila
Sogamilla baaramila sogamilla baaramila
Intha hey intha hey intha
Intha hey intha hey intha
Intha hey intha hey intha
Intha hey ...
