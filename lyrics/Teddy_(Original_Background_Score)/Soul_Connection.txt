Here are the lyrics to "Soul Connection" by D. Imman:

(Tabla & Strings Intro)

(Verse 1)
In my mind each night
A voice so clear and bright
Like a song I've known forever
But couldn't place why
Till I saw you standing there
Everything aligned

(Pre-Chorus)
All those nights I wandered
Through spaces between sleep and dawn
Every step was leading
Right where I belong

(Chorus)
I knew your soul before I knew your face
(Before I knew your face)
Every dream was drawing me your way
Like stars that dance in space
I knew your soul before I knew your face

(Verse 2)
Strange how time stands still
When memories fulfill
All the pieces coming together
Like rain to the sea
Every note you sing to me
Sets my spirit free

(Pre-Chorus)
All those days I waited
Not knowing what to find
Every prayer I whispered
Led me to this time

(Chorus)
I knew your soul before I knew your face
(Before I knew your face)
Every dream was drawing me your way
Like stars that dance in space
I knew your soul before I knew your face

(Bridge)
Two hearts beating as one (Two hearts)
Two paths merging to run (Two paths)
Never felt so complete
Never felt so at home

(Outro)
I knew your soul (I've always known)
Before I knew your face (Your face)
(Strings & Tabla fade)
