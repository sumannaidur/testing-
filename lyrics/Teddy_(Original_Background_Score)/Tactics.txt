I was unable to find the lyrics for the song "Tactics" by D. Imman. There are mentions of songs with the title "Tactics" by other artists such as Dig Dat, Joey Valence & Brae, and Richmond Tactics by Coolie-T. Additionally, "Tactics" is the name of an anime with associated songs. There is also a song called "Vethaala Kathai (From 2K Love Story)" by D. Imman.
