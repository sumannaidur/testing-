5 ContributorsNonsense Ki Night LyricsThis is one of the main soundtracks for the Movie Happy New Year This song mainly features famous Hindi proverbs and idioms literally translated into English.Oh ho ye...

Ho Dance not coming, courtyard crooked
Eating cake by being stupid
Buffalo going in the water
(Gayi bhains paani mein)
If you tiger, me tiger & quarter
If you tiger, me tiger & quarter

I'm feeling alright
Cause it's a nonsense ki night (x4)

Oh monkey what know flavour of ginger
(Arey flavour of ginger)
In the jungle peacock is dancing
Who has seen her...
Whose is stick, his is buffalo
Whose is stick, his is buffalo
Whose is stick, his is buffalo
But remember hundred of goldsmiths equals one of blacksmith

I'm feeling alright
Cause it's a nonsense ki night (x4)

Haay..
Clouds that make noise, don't rain
Clouds that make noise, don't rain..
Staying in water don't be enemy of crocodile
Staying in water don't be enemy of crocodile
Staying in water don't be enemy of crocodile..
Why...? Because..


I'm feeling alright
Cause it's a nonsense ki night (x4)

All is in the well
If end is in the well (x4)

Ho baaqi duniya go to hell!
