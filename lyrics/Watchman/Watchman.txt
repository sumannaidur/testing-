Even through the trauma
Where my friends away
The darkness is upon us
The death of saints ain't new
But I will sing my song for you anyway
You're all I have, Lord, you are the way
And I'll always love you and I will wait
Like a watchman at the gate
Waiting for morning to break
I can feel the winds changing
Getting further down the range
Truth is we'll get stranger
Than the lies cause it's simple and it's holy
It's better than it seems
Jesus, you're mine, God, and you're all I am
You are always and I'll always love you and I will wait
Like a watchman at the gate
Waiting for morning to break
With me, you say, "Come on, enter into my rest
And lay your head upon my chest
For I have called you friend because you kept your lamp burning through the night
And you made your garments pure and white"
Through my goodness, yeah, singing now
My kingdom is within man
So come up to my table and raise up this clay with me
Oh, no more tears and no more pain
I'm a-making all things new again, just like I promised you
