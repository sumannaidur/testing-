1 ContributorDARE Lyrics[バニラビーンズ「DARE feat. RAM RIDER」歌詞]

[Intro]
It's coming up, it’s coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up
It’s coming up, it's coming up
It's dare
It's dare

[Chorus]
You've got to press it on you
You've just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, dare
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
It feels like you were there yourself, work it out

[Post-Chorus]
Never did no harm, never did no harm
It's dare
It’s coming up, it’s coming up
It's coming up, it’s coming up
It's coming up
It's dare


[Chorus]
You've got to press it on you
You’ve just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, dare
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
It feels like you were there yourself, work it out

[Post-Chorus]
Never did no harm, never did no harm
It's dare
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up
It's dare
Never did no harm, never did no harm
It's darе
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up
It's dare

[Chorus]
You've got to press it on you
You'vе just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, dare
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
It feels like you were there yourself, work it out
You've got to press it on you
You've just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, dare
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
It feels like you were there yourself, work it out
