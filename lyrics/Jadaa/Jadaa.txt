Based on the search results, there appear to be multiple songs titled "Jadaa" or similar. To provide you with the correct lyrics, I need to know which specific "Jadaa" song by "Gulshan Music" you're interested in.

However, I found lyrics for a song called "Pithu Aala Bag" by Raj Mawar, with music by Gulshan Music. The lyrics include the following lines which seem to contain the word "Jada":

"gala parol pura jumka Ki latka bijli Jada lag ro ka jatka"

and

"husn kaataka kol ko ka to ki juari"

If this isn't the song you were looking for, please provide more information, such as a link to the song or more specific details, so I can find the correct lyrics for you.
