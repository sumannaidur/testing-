10 ContributorsCity Slums Lyrics[Intro: Divine]
Gully Gang
Kumari

[Chorus : Raja Kumari]
Run and tell your mummy
The streets go ra pa pum pum
Ra pa pum pum, ra pa pum pum
It’s coming from the gully
It’s coming from the city slums slums
City slums slums
City slums slums

[Verse 1: Divine]
Sadak zabani, chaye mein paani
Hath mein kaarigari
Naka ab khaali, bhaari thaali
Sar pe zimmedari
Ek hi to maalik
Baaki kuchh din wale karamchari
Kaahe ka beef tu is rap khel mein shakahari
Bahut jaali
Yeh rapper famous huye deke gaali, lambi gaadi
Asliyat mein inki jebein khaali, kalakaari
Haan maas lega humse brahmachari, kar sawari
Apni wahi gully, wahi chaali
Kitni naari, kitni chaabi
Note tere kitni saari
Nahi aane wale kaam tere maiyyat pe, swayam se
Jhooth na tu bol paayega
Apne aad fassa kharcha fokat mein tu khayega


[Chorus : Raja Kumari]
Run and tell your mummy
The streets go ra pa pum pum
Ra pa pum pum , ra pa pum pum
It’s coming from the gully
It’s coming from the city slum slums
City slum slums
City slum slums

[Verse 2: Raja Kumari]
Raja Kumari
I go harder than anybody
Daughter of the king American dream
Phir bhi dil mein hindustani
So don’t misunderstand me
I do it for the people
Yes I do it for my family, mainly
I'm gonna get it, I’m with it
I make it run run
I’m gonna get it
I’m in it, until it’s done done
They tried to stop me
Don’t make the same mistake
They tried to copy
But they can’t take my place
Coz Oh god! Oh god!


All eyes on the underdog
Go hard, go hard
No time for you none at all
Whole squad, whole squad
Four tires on the boulevard
Running through the streets at dark
Flowing like the ganga
Gangotri!

[Chorus : Raja Kumari]
Run and tell your mummy
The streets go ra pa pum pum
Ra pa pum pum , ra pa pum pum
It’s coming from the gully
It’s coming from the city slum slums
City slum slums
City slum slums

[Bridge : Raja Kumari & Divine]
Jaake poochh, jaake poochh apne baare mein
Gully gang is the sound of the slums
From LA to Bombay
Know we coming up, you know we coming up
You know we coming up!
Jaake poochh, jaake poochh apne baare mein
Gully gang is the sound of the slums
From LA to Bombay
Know we coming up, you know we coming up
Yeah!


[Chorus: Raja Kumari]
Run and tell your mummy
The streets go ra pa pum pum
Ra pa pum pum , ra pa pum pum
It’s coming from the gully
It’s coming from the city slum slums
City slum slums
City slum slums

[Outro: Divine]
Raja Kumari
Hindustan mein kya!
Tera bhai, tera bhai
5 9
Gully gang boy
Haan jaake poochh apne baare mein
