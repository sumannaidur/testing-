6 ContributorsIshq Bulaava LyricsIshq bulava aave jab aave..
Main ta kol tere rehna
Main ta baitha kol tere..

I don't know when the call of love will come
I have to be with you
I sit with you only..

Tainu takda ravaan
Baaton pe teri hansda ravaan
Pagal main khud nu banaanda ravaan
Tu hansdi rave, main hansaanda ravaan
Tenu takda ravan...

I keep looking at you
I keep laughing at your talks
I keep making a fool of myself
[as in, to make you laugh]
You keep laughing, and I keep making you laugh..
I keep looking at you..

Ajeeb rangaan di tu hai badi
Lage alag hi jahaan di

You're one of very strange colors..
Look like one from another world


Ae to nazraan nazraan di gal ve
Tu vi sun le zaraa

This depends on the eyes (of the one who looks)
[lietrally: it's a thought of eyes from eyes]
You to listen to it..

Main taa kol tere rehna
Main taa rehna kol tere...

Tainu takdi rawaan
Naina 'ch tere main vasdi ravaan

I keep looking at you
I keep living in your eyes

Paagal main khud nu banaunda ravaan
Tu hansdi rave, main hansanda ravaan
Tainu takda ravaan

Ishq duaavan jaane kab aave
Ishq duaavan aave jab aave

I don't know when the blessing of love comes
Let the blessing of love come whenever it does..


Main ta kol tere rehna
Main taa baitha kol tere...

Tainu takda ravaan
Baaton pe teri hansda ravaan
Pagal main khud nu banaanda rawaan
Tu hansdi rave, main hansanda ravaan
Tenu takda rawaan
