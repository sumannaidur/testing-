2 ContributorsGallan Goodiyaan LyricsMain daalun taal pe bhangra tu bhi gidda paa le chal aisa rang jamaa de hum ke bane sabhi matwaale

I’ll dance Bhangra on the beat, you too dance the vulture dance, come, let’s have such fun here, that everyone goes crazy having fun..

Mann kahe ki main le aaun chaand aur taare saare in haathon par main chaand rakhoon is maang mein bhar doon taare

The heart says I’ll go and get moon and all the stars, I’ll keep moon there in these hands, and fill the stars in your hair parting.

Hello! Hello! Tu floor pe kab hai aayi ye lo, ye lo, baDi solid masti chaayi
Hello! Hello! Too much hai tumne lagaayi ye lo, ye lo, control karo mere bhai

Hello, Hello, when did you come to the floor, take this, take this, what a solid fun is going on here.. hello, hello, you have had (drunk) too much, take this, take this, control my brother..

Dhak-dhak dhak-dhak dhadke ye dil chhan chhan bole amritsari choodiyaan raat badi hai mastaani koi dilbar jaani kar le gallan goodiyaan

The heart beats, thump-thump, and Amritsar’s bangles jingle, the night is such a fun, some beloved should talk sweetly (to me)..

Chhanaa chhanaka tere tana dutanaka tere chhanaa chhanaka tere tana dutanaka tera..

Doesn’t have a meaning, it’s more like singing some beats.

Main kabootar faseya ki hor koi fase hi na haay fase hi na

I, a pigeon, am trapped, but no other gets trapped..

Ye baat na maine jaani kyun itni khush hai diwaani tu mujhko aisi kahaani samjha de, samjha de..


I have known this thing why the crazy one is so happy, you tell me such a story, such a story..

Ye baat hai sabne chaahi mile janmon ka humraahi yahaan huaa hai kuch aisa hi samjhe na samjhe na o ho..

Every one has wanted this thing, that we get a partner for all our lives (even if there are more than one lives) here something like that has happened, you have got it, right?

Ab main jaana keh rahi ho kya fasaana ho ho. Pyaar karne se bhi mushqil hai nibhaana ho ho

Now I have understood what story you have been telling, it is tougher to maintain love on than falling in love..

Hello! Hello! Don't mind mera ye kehna ye lo, ye lo, zara mere touch mein rehna

Hello, hello, don’t mind when I say this, take this, take this, be in touch..

Dhak-dhak dhak-dhak dhadke ye dil chhan chhan bole amritsari choodiyan raat badi hai mastaani koi dilbar jaani kar le gallan goodiyan raat badi hai mastaanee..

O marjaana oye!

marjaana is a mild abuse in Punjabi, the literal word of the meaning is mortal, liable to death.
