Here are the lyrics to "Eternal Love Of Father" by Sam C.S., based on the information available:

He's a mountain strong and steady rise
Love like rivers never dries
Holds our dreams in calloused hands
Guides us through with gentle plans
He's the dawn when night is cold
In his arms, I'm never old
Tales of wisdom etched in scars
Leading us like northern stars

Oh my hero standing tall
Through life's twists you catch my fall
In your shadow I will grow
Father's love the purest flow
Silent strength yet words so kind
In his eyes the heavens find
Heart like thunder soft as rain
Healing wounds that caused me pain
Through the storm and in the calm
I find peace within his palm
Every lesson every song
With you dad I will belong
Years will pass and seasons change
But his love will still remain
Legacy in every beat
Father's love a melody so sweet

He's the dawn when night is cold
In his arms, I'm never old
Tales of wisdom etched in scars
Leading us like northern stars
Oh my hero standing tall
Through life's twists you catch my fall
In your shadow I will grow
Father's love the purest flow
Silent strength yet words so kind
In his eyes the heavens find
Heart like thunder soft as rain
Healing wounds that caused me pain
Through the storm and in the calm
I find peace within his palm
Every lesson every song
With you dad I will belong
Years will pass and seasons change
But his love will still remain
Legacy in every beat
Father's love a melody so sweet
